# 2D Godot Train
A simple implementation of a 2D train mechanic for Godot games.

This provides train tracks and switches (built with of Path2D nodes), and train engines and vehicles (using PathFollow2D nodes.)

There are a number of elements you can change to make the trains behave . Specifically:
* Customizable wheel-separation and vehicle-follow distances
* Friction forces (kinetic, air, & rolling)
* Environment conditions (gravity strength, air density)
* Vehicle mass

This also includes a few demo train track sample scenes and a chase camera.

## Running the demo project
Open the game in Godot and press Play.
